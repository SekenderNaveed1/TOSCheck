# TOSCheck

TOSCheck exists because reading the Terms of Service is important, and most people simply don’t do it.

I’d been bored for a while and wanted something new to build, but this idea stuck after reading a story about a chess.com player who won $1000 just by reading the Terms and Conditions for Chess.com, that everyone else ignored. It’s a funny story, but also a reminder that nobody reads the fine print, even though it quietly decides how companies can use your data and what rights you sign away without realizing it.

TOSCheck is my way of doing something about that. It’s a project meant to actually read what people skip. It scans Terms of Service and Privacy Policies, highlights the parts that stand out, and tries to make sense of the stuff that’s usually written to be ignored. The goal is to make this process easier, fairer, and a little more honest.

I’ve worked on other projects before, like Equigrade, which aimed to make grading fairer in education. That project never really took off. It was finished in fall 2023 and, honestly, never had any active users. The timing didn’t help. With LLMs becoming common in programming classes, beginner coursework changed fast. Students could now use AI to write one-line loops or finish full assignments instantly, so a lot of professors shifted to test-based grading instead.

TOSCheck comes from the same motivation as Equigrade did: wanting to build something that gives people more clarity and control. The difference is that this one is smaller, simpler, and more personal. It’s not about building something huge; it’s about building something that should have existed already.

And hopefully, unlike Equigrade, TOSCheck actually ends up with a few users who aren’t just me testing it at 2 a.m. and pretending I’m doing research.

Most people don’t read the fine print because it’s long, boring, and often written to be unreadable. But the words matter. They always have. This project is a reminder that understanding what you agree to shouldn’t feel impossible.

If this tool helps even one person stop and actually read what they’re signing, I’ll count that as a win.

Also, I bet most of you won’t even read this README, which is kind of funny considering that’s literally the point of this entire project.

And just to set expectations, TOSCheck isn’t really meant for people who haven’t messed around with programming or setting up projects on GitHub yet. It’s not complicated, but it does take a little setup. Which, to be fair, can be annoying sometimes — though it’s 2025, so there’s probably an LLM somewhere that’ll walk you through it anyway.
