# TOSCheck

TOSCheck exists because reading the Terms of Service is important, and most people don’t do it.

I’ve been bored for a while and wanted something to work on, but this idea stuck after reading a story about Eric Rosen, the chess player who won $1000 just by reading the Terms and Conditions that everyone else ignored. It sounds funny at first, but it actually says a lot about how we treat the fine print. We skip it, scroll past it, and click “I agree,” even though those documents define how companies use our data, what rights we give up, and what happens when something goes wrong.

TOSCheck is my way of doing something about that. It’s a project meant to read what most people don’t. It scans Terms of Service and Privacy Policies and points out the parts that deserve attention — the lines about data sharing, arbitration, or one-sided changes that are easy to miss. The goal is to make this process easier, fairer, and more transparent.

I’ve worked on other projects before, like Equigrade, which tried to make grading fairer in education. TOSCheck comes from the same place: wanting to build something that gives people more clarity and control. The difference is that this one’s smaller, simpler, and more personal. It’s not about making something complex; it’s about making something that should already exist.

Most people don’t read the fine print because they don’t have time or because it’s written in a way that discourages them. But the words matter. They always have. This project is a reminder that understanding what you agree to shouldn’t feel impossible.

If this tool helps even one person stop and actually read what they’re signing, then it’s worth it.
