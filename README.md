# TOSCheck

TOSCheck exists because reading the Terms of Service is important, and most people simply don’t do it.

I’d been bored for a while and wanted something new to build, but this idea stuck after reading a story about a Chess.com playerwho won $1000 just by reading the Terms and Conditions that everyone else ignored. It sounds funny, but it says a lot about how we treat the fine print. We scroll, click “I agree,” and move on, even though those documents quietly decide how our data is used and what rights we give away.

TOSCheck is my way of doing something about that. It’s a project meant to read what most people skip. It goes through Terms of Service and Privacy Policies and points out the parts that deserve attention, like data sharing, arbitration, and vague change clauses. The goal is to make that process easier and a little more honest.

I’ve worked on other projects before, like Equigrade, which aimed to make grading fairer in education. That project never really took off. It was finished in fall 2023 and, to be honest, never had any active users. The timing didn’t help either. Once LLMs started showing up in programming classes, beginner coursework shifted. Students could write an entire assignment with a one-line prompt, and professors responded by making classes more test-heavy.  

TOSCheck comes from the same motivation as Equigrade did: building something that gives people more clarity and control. The difference is that this one is smaller, simpler, and more personal. It’s not trying to reinvent anything; it’s just something that should have existed already.  

And hopefully, unlike Equigrade, TOSCheck actually ends up with a few users who aren’t just me testing it at 2 a.m.

Most people don’t read the fine print because it’s long, dense, and designed to make your eyes glaze over. But the words matter. They always have. This project is a reminder that understanding what you agree to doesn’t have to be painful, and maybe, with a bit of help, it can even be interesting.

If this tool helps even one person stop and actually read what they’re signing, I’ll count that as a win.
