# CATEGORY: DATA COLLECTION, SHARING, PROFILING & RETENTION
# PURPOSE: Flag broad, invasive, or vague data practices; indefinite retention; third-party sharing/ads; cross-service profiling.
# SIGNALS: “collect”, “share with affiliates/partners”, “combine”, “retain”, “sell”, “analytics”, “advertising”, “biometric”.

## Canonical risky patterns
- "We collect **location**, **camera**, **microphone**, **contacts**, **messages**, **payment**, **biometric** data."
  → High sensitivity (GDPR special categories, state biometric laws).
- "We **share** data with **affiliates**, **partners**, **service providers**, and **advertising networks**."
  → Broad downstream use; hard to track.
- "We **combine** your data with information from **third parties**."
  → Cross-platform profiling and re-identification risk.
- "We **retain** personal information **indefinitely**/**as needed**."
  → Lack of clear retention schedule.
- "We may **sell**/“monetize” insights or **aggregate** data without clear de-identification standards."
  → Re-identification risk; CCPA/CPRA “sale/share” implications.

## Examples (realistic)
1) "We collect **precise location** and **microphone recordings** to enhance your experience."
2) "We share information with **trusted partners and affiliates** for **analytics and targeted advertising**."
3) "We may **combine** your account data with **data brokers**."
4) "We **retain** data **for as long as necessary** for business purposes."
5) "We may **sell aggregated insights** to third parties."

## Heuristics / detection cues
- Watch vague lists (“including but not limited to”).
- Look for “partners,” “affiliates,” “service providers,” “SDKs,” “pixels,” “cookies,” “advertising.”
- Check retention: “indefinite,” “as long as necessary.”

## Risk notes / legal references (non-legal-advice)
- GDPR: legal bases (consent/contract/legitimate interests), transparency, purpose limitation, storage limitation, DPIAs.
- US: CPRA (sale/share definitions), state biometric/privacy laws; children’s privacy (COPPA).

## Mitigations / reader guidance
- Demand a **data map** and **retention schedule**; request opt-outs.
- Use **least-privilege** app permissions; disable sensitive sensors.
- For vendors: DPAs, SCCs, and subprocessors list with change notifications.
