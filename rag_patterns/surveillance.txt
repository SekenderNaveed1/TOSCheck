# CATEGORY: SURVEILLANCE, MONITORING & RECORDING
# PURPOSE: Identify invasive tracking, keylogging, screen capture, audio/video recording, employee/consumer monitoring.
# SIGNALS: “monitor”, “record”, “keystrokes”, “screen capture”, “telemetry”, “behavioral data”, “AI training”.

## Canonical risky patterns
- "We **monitor** user activity, including **messages**, **browsing**, **keystrokes**, or **screen contents**."
  → Highly invasive; consent/notice requirements vary.
- "We **record audio/video** for **quality**/**training** purposes."
  → Sensitive data capture; retention/usage unclear.
- "We collect **telemetry** including app usage, device identifiers, installed software."
  → Profiling risk; cross-device tracking.
- "Data may be used to **train AI models**."
  → Potentially broad reuse beyond original purpose.

## Examples (realistic)
1) "We may **record calls and video sessions** to improve service quality."
2) "We employ **fraud detection** that includes monitoring **keyboard/mouse activity**."
3) "We collect **screen analytics** and **session replays**."

## Heuristics / detection cues
- Found in Privacy Policy or “Monitoring” sections; check EULA clauses for workplace tools.
- Words like “session replay,” “behavioral analytics,” “RUM,” “telemetry.”

## Risk notes / legal references (non-legal-advice)
- Wiretap/recording consent laws (one-party vs. two-party states).
- GDPR: transparency, purpose limitation, DPIAs for high-risk processing.
- Workplace monitoring: specific laws and notice requirements.

## Mitigations / reader guidance
- Provide **explicit opt-in** for recordings; clear retention limits.
- Disable highly invasive trackers by default; allow **per-feature consent**.
- Separate **training data** from operational data with opt-outs.
