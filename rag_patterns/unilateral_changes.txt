# CATEGORY: UNILATERAL CHANGES & SERVICE CONTROL
# PURPOSE: Flag terms allowing one-sided modification of ToS, policy updates without notice, unilateral termination, feature removal.
# SIGNALS: “we may modify at any time”, “without notice”, “sole discretion”, “suspend/terminate”, “retroactive”.

## Canonical risky patterns
- "We may **modify these terms at any time** **without notice**."
  → Users bound to unseen changes; transparency issue.
- "Continued use constitutes **acceptance** of updates."
  → Passive consent; users may miss changes.
- "We may **suspend or terminate** service/account **at our sole discretion**."
  → No cause required; risk of sudden loss.
- "We may **remove features** or **discontinue services** at any time, without liability."
  → Business continuity risk.
- "Changes may apply **retroactively**."
  → Past behavior suddenly judged by new rules.

## Examples (realistic)
1) "We can **update** these Terms **at any time**; check back regularly."
2) "We may **suspend or terminate** accounts for any reason."
3) "We may **deprecate features** or **shut down** the service without compensation."

## Heuristics / detection cues
- Often at the end of ToS (“Miscellaneous”); “Changes,” “Updates,” “Termination” sections.
- Look for lack of notice periods, versioning, or changelogs.

## Risk notes / legal references (non-legal-advice)
- EU consumer law expects transparency and fairness; unilateral change terms may be scrutinized.
- B2B contracts generally negotiate change-control and termination conditions.

## Mitigations / reader guidance
- Require **advance notice** (e.g., 30 days) and **email notifications**.
- For B2B: add **material adverse change** definition + right to terminate or continue on old terms.
- Maintain a **public changelog** and versioned ToS; avoid retroactivity.
