# CATEGORY: PAYMENTS, REFUNDS & AUTO-RENEWAL
# PURPOSE: Catch no-refund terms, silent auto-renewals, mid-term price changes, chargeback bans, unilateral billing.
# SIGNALS: “non-refundable”, “auto-renew”, “at our discretion”, “price changes”, “chargeback”, “proration”.

## Canonical risky patterns
- "**All fees are non-refundable**," including outages or early cancellation.
  → No recourse for failed service.
- "Subscriptions **auto-renew** unless canceled **in writing** in advance."
  → Friction to cancel; surprise charges.
- "We may **change prices at any time** without notice."
  → Lack of transparency; consumer law issues.
- "**Chargebacks** are prohibited; disputes must be handled **internally**."
  → Removes card network protections.
- "We may **suspend/terminate service** for any reason without refund."
  → One-sided power.

## Examples (realistic)
1) "All payments are **non-refundable**, including unused portions."
2) "Your subscription **automatically renews** each month until canceled."
3) "We may **modify fees** upon posting updates to our website."
4) "You agree **not to initiate a chargeback** with your card issuer."

## Heuristics / detection cues
- Billing in “Payment Terms,” “Subscriptions,” “Cancellations.”
- Unclear cancellation mechanics (email/fax only, short windows).
- Vague price-change language with no notice period.

## Risk notes / legal references (non-legal-advice)
- US: State auto-renewal laws (e.g., California ARL), FTC negative option rule proposals.
- EU: Consumer Rights Directive (pre-contract info, withdrawal rights).

## Mitigations / reader guidance
- Require **clear cancellation** paths and **advance notice** of price changes.
- Offer **pro-rated refunds** for downtime; define SLA credits.
- Keep **chargeback rights** intact or provide robust independent ADR.
