* **Perpetual License to User Content**: "By uploading content, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable license to use, modify, and distribute your submissions."

## Clause 4

**Clause text:**

You may exercise your rights to access, delete, or restrict the use of your personal information under applicable law.

**Explanation:**

**Plain-Language Summary**
This clause explains that your personal data may be transferred to other countries and will be kept for as long as necessary. You have the right to access, delete, or restrict the use of your data under applicable law.

**Risks/Implications:**

* **International Data Transfer**: Your data "may be transferred internationally" which raises concerns about data protection laws in foreign jurisdictions (Pattern [2] ## Risk notes / legal references).
* **Data Retention**: The clause states that data will be retained for as long as necessary to fulfill business purposes or legal obligations, but it does not specify a clear timeframe or criteria for deletion (no direct match, but Pattern [1] ## Mitigations / reader guidance suggests providing more transparency and control over data retention).
* **Limited Rights**: The clause mentions that you can exercise your rights under applicable law, but it does not explicitly provide information about how to do so or what those rights are. This may leave users uncertain about their ability to access, delete, or restrict the use of their data (Pattern [1] ## Mitigations / reader guidance suggests providing more explicit opt-out and deletion options).

**Explanation:**

**Plain-Language Summary**

The clause requires users to opt out in writing if they don't want to use the service. It also warns that children under 13 need parental consent to use the service.

**Risks and Implications**

* **Lack of clear opt-out mechanism**: The clause does not provide a straightforward way for users to opt out, which may lead to continued usage without explicit consent.
	+ "If you wish to opt out, please print and mail a written request..." (clause)
* **Unclear notice requirements**: The clause only mentions posting updates on the page, but it's unclear how users will be notified of changes or if they'll receive direct notice.
	+ "...We will provide notice of any updates by posting them on this page." (clause)
* **Parental consent requirement for minors**: While well-intentioned, this requirement may create difficulties for parents who want to allow their children to use the service with some level of autonomy.
