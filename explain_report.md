Here's my analysis:

* **Limited liability**: "We are not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages." (limited liability)
* **Indemnification**: "You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of your use." (indemnification)

**Likely category:** UNILATERAL_CHANGES

* **Non-Refundable Payments:** "All payments are non-refundable." (refund_policies.txt)
	+ No recourse for failed service or dissatisfaction with the product.
* **Automatic Renewal:** "Subscriptions automatically renew each month unless canceled in writing via postal mail. Free trials will automatically convert to paid plans unless you cancel before renewal." (refund_policies.txt)
	+ Friction to cancel; surprise charges.
* **Price Increases:** "We reserve the right to increase prices or fees with or without notice." (refund_policies.txt)

**Explanation:**

Here's my analysis:

**Summary:** The Terms of Service clause allows users to access, delete, or restrict their personal information under applicable law. However, it requires a written request by mail for opting out and does not provide clear notice of updates. Additionally, children under 13 should have parental consent before using the service.

**Risks/Implications:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The clause does not specify how users will be notified about updates to their personal information or changes to the Terms of Service.
* **Inadequate opt-out mechanism:** Users must print and mail a written request to opt out, which may be inconvenient and difficult for some individuals.
* **Parental consent requirement:** Children under 13 are required to have parental consent before using the service, but it is unclear what specific requirements or procedures will be followed.

**Likely category: DATA_COLLECTION**

The clause mentions personal information and access rights, which aligns with the data collection patterns in the KB.
